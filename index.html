        intended as a primary offensive weapon in front-line ground combat. Tank
        designs are a balance of heavy firepower, strong armor, and good
        battlefield mobility provided by tracks and a powerful engine; usually
        their main armament is mounted in a turret. They are a mainstay of
        modern 20th and 21st century ground forces and a key part of combined
        arms combat. Modern tanks are versatile mobile land weapons platforms
        whose main armament is a large-caliber tank gun mounted in a rotating
        gun turret, supplemented by machine guns or other ranged weapons such as
        anti-tank guided missiles or rocket launchers. They have heavy

        which provides protection for the crew, the vehicle's munition storage,
        fuel tank and propulsion systems. The use of tracks rather than wheels
        provides improved operational mobility which allows the tank to overcome
        rugged terrain and adverse conditions such as mud and ice/snow better
        than wheeled vehicles, and thus be more flexibly positioned at
        advantageous locations on the battlefield. These features enable the
        tank to perform well in a variety of intense combat situations,
        simultaneously both offensively (with direct fire from their powerful
        main gun) and defensively (as fire support and defilade for friendly
        troops due to the near invulnerability to common infantry small arms and
        good resistance against most heavier weapons), all while maintaining the
        mobility needed to exploit changing tactical situations.[1] Fully
        integrating tanks into modern military forces spawned a new era of
        combat:

          style="text-decoration: none"
          >armored warfare</a
        >. Until the arrival of the main battle tank, tanks were typically
        categorized either by weight class (light, medium, heavy or superheavy
        tanks) or doctrinal purpose (breakthrough-, cavalry-, infantry-,
        cruiser-, or reconnaissance tanks). Some being larger and very heavily
        armored and with large guns, while others are smaller, lightly armored,
        and equipped with a smaller caliber and lighter gun. These smaller tanks
        move over terrain with speed and agility and can perform a
        reconnaissance role in addition to engaging enemy targets. The smaller,
        faster tank would not normally engage in battle with a larger, heavily
        armored tank, except during a surprise flanking manoeuvre.

        The first tank prototype, Little Willie, was unveiled in September 1915.
        Following its underwhelming performance–it was slow, became overheated
        and couldn’t cross trenches–a second prototype, known as “Big Willie,”
        was produced. By 1916, this armored vehicle was deemed ready for battle
        and made its debut at the First

        Mark I, this first batch of tanks was hot, noisy and unwieldy and
        suffered mechanical malfunctions on the battlefield; nevertheless,
        people realized the tank’s potential. Further design improvements were

      deep independent armored penetrations were executed by the Germans, a
      technique later called blitzkrieg. Blitzkrieg used innovative combined
      arms tactics and radios in all of the tanks to provide a level of tactical
      flexibility and power that surpassed that of the Allied armor. The French
      Army, with tanks equal or superior to the German tanks in both quality and
      quantity, employed a linear defensive strategy in which the armored
      cavalry units were made subservient to the needs of the infantry armies to
      cover their entrenchment in Belgium. In addition, they lacked radios in
      many of their tanks and headquarters, which limited their ability to
      respond to German attacks.
    </p>
    <p class="rosi">
      In accordance with blitzkrieg methods, German tanks bypassed enemy
      strongpoints and could radio for close air support to destroy them, or
      leave them to the infantry. A related development, motorized infantry,
      allowed some of the troops to keep up with the tanks and create highly
      mobile combined arms forces. The defeat of a major military power within
      weeks shocked the rest of the world, spurring tank and anti-tank weapon
      development.
    </p>
    <p class="rosi">
      The North African Campaign also provided an important battleground for
      tanks, as the flat, desolate terrain with relatively few obstacles or
      urban environments was ideal for conducting mobile armored warfare.
      However, this battlefield also showed the importance of logistics,
      especially in an armored force, as the principal warring armies, the
      German Afrika Korps and the British Eighth Army, often outpaced their
      supply trains in repeated attacks and counter-attacks on each other,
      resulting in complete stalemate. This situation would not be resolved
      until 1942, when during the Second Battle of El Alamein, the Afrika Korps,
      crippled by disruptions in their supply lines, had 95% of its tanks
      destroyed and was forced to retreat by a massively reinforced Eighth Army,
      the first in a series of defeats that would eventually lead to the
      surrender of the remaining Axis forces in Tunisia.

    <h3>1. Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger Ausf. E</h3>
    <p class="rosi">
      The Tiger I (About this soundlisten (help·info)) was a German heavy tank
      of World War II that operated beginning in 1942 in Africa and in the
      Soviet Union, usually in independent heavy tank battalions. It gave the
      German Army its first armoured fighting vehicle that mounted the 8.8 cm
      KwK 36 gun (derived from the 8.8 cm Flak 36). 1,347 were built between
      August 1942 and August 1944. After August 1944, production of the Tiger I
      was phased out in favour of the Tiger II.
    </p>
    <div class="ummar">

      />
      <p class="rosi">
        While the Tiger I has been called an outstanding design for its time, it
        has also been called over-engineered, using expensive materials and
        labour-intensive production methods. In the early period Tiger was prone
        to certain types of track failures and breakdowns and was in general
        limited in range by its high fuel consumption. It was expensive to
        maintain, but generally mechanically reliable. It was difficult to
        transport and vulnerable to immobilisation when mud, ice, and snow froze
        between its overlapping and interleaved Schachtellaufwerk-pattern road
        wheels, often jamming them solid. This was a problem on the Eastern
        Front in the muddy rasputitsa season and during periods of extreme cold
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="rosi">
      The tank was given its nickname "Tiger" by Ferdinand Porsche, and the
      Roman numeral was added after the Tiger II entered production. The initial
      designation was Panzerkampfwagen VI Ausführung H (literally "armoured
      combat vehicle VI version H", abbreviated PzKpfw VI Ausf. H) where 'H'
      denoted Henschel as the designer/manufacturer. It was classified with
      ordnance inventory designation Sd.Kfz. 182. The tank was later
      re-designated as PzKpfw VI Ausf. E in March 1943, with ordnance inventory
      designation Sd.Kfz. 181.

    <p class="rosi">
      Today, only seven Tiger I tanks survive in museums and private collections
      worldwide. As of 2021,

    <h3>2. Panzerkampfwagen V Panther</h3>
    <p class="rosi">
      The Panther is a German medium tank deployed during World War II on the
      Eastern and Western Fronts in Europe from mid-1943 to the war's end in
      1945. It had the ordnance inventory designation of Sd.Kfz. 171. It was
      designated as the Panzerkampfwagen V Panther until 27 February 1944, when
      Hitler ordered that the Roman numeral "V" be deleted. Contemporary
      English-language reports sometimes refer to it as the "Mark V".
    </p>
    <p class="rosi">
      The Panther was intended to counter the Soviet T-34 and to replace the
      Panzer III and Panzer IV. Nevertheless, it served alongside the Panzer IV
      and the heavier Tiger I until the end of the war. It is considered one of
      the best tanks of World War II for its excellent firepower and protection,
      although its reliability and mobility were less impressive; another
      drawback was the difficulty of maintenance in the field
    </p>
    <div class="ummar">
      <img
        src="./assets/panther.jpg"
        alt=""
        style="margin-right: 50px; width: 380px; height: 250px"
      />
      <p class="rosi">
        The Panther was a compromise. While having essentially the same Maybach
        V12 petrol (690 hp) engine as the Tiger I, it had more effective frontal
        hull armour,[9] better gun penetration, was lighter and faster, and
        could traverse rough terrain better than the Tiger I. The trade-off was
        weaker side armour, which made it vulnerable to flanking fire. The
        Panther proved to be effective in open country and long-range
        engagements
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="rosi">
      The Panther was far cheaper to produce than the Tiger I. Key elements of
      the Panther design, such as its armour, transmission, and final drive,
      were simplifications made to improve production rates and address raw
      material shortages. The overall design remained described by some as
      "overengineered".[11][12] The Panther was rushed into combat at the Battle
      of Kursk in the summer of 1943 despite numerous unresolved technical
      problems, leading to high losses due to mechanical failure. Most design
      flaws were rectified by late 1943 and early 1944, though the bombing of
      production plants, increasing shortages of high-quality alloys for
      critical components, shortage of fuel and training space, and the
      declining quality of crews all impacted the tank's effectiveness
    </p>
    <p class="rosi">
      Though officially classified as a medium tank, its weight is more like
      that of a heavy tank, as its weight of 44.8 metric tons puts it roughly in
      the same category as the American M26 Pershing (41.7 tons), British
      Churchill (40.7 tons) and the Soviet IS-2 (46 tons) heavy tanks. The tank
      had a very high power-to-weight ratio, making it highly mobile regardless
      of its tonnage. Its weight still caused logistical problems, such as an
      inability to cross certain bridges. The naming of Panther production
      variants did not, unlike most German tanks, follow alphabetical order: the
      initial variant, Panther "D" (Ausf. D), was followed by "A" and "G"
      variants.

    <h3>3. M4 Sherman</h3>
    <div class="ummar">
      <img
        src="./assets/sherman tank.jpg"
        alt=""

      />
      <p class="rosi">
        The M4 Sherman, officially Medium Tank, M4, was the most widely used
        medium tank by the United States and Western Allies in World War II. The
        M4 Sherman proved to be reliable, relatively cheap to produce, and
        available in great numbers. It was also the basis of several other
        armored fighting vehicles including self-propelled artillery, tank
        destroyers, and recovery vehicles. Tens of thousands were distributed
        through the Lend-Lease program to the British Commonwealth and Soviet
        Union. The tank was named by the British for the American Civil War
        general William Tecumseh Sherman
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="rosi">
      The M4 Sherman evolved from the M3 Medium Tank,[N 1] which – for speed of
      development – had its main armament in a side sponson mount. The M4
      retained much of the previous mechanical design, but moved the main 75 mm
      gun into a fully traversing central turret. One feature, a one-axis
      gyrostabilizer, was not precise enough to allow firing when moving but did
      help keep the gun aimed in roughly the right direction for when the tank
      stopped to fire.[7] The designers stressed reliability, ease of production
      and maintenance, durability, standardization of parts and ammunition in a
      limited number of variants, and moderate size and weight (to facilitate
      shipping and for compatibility with existing bridging equipment.). These
      factors, combined with Sherman's then-superior armor and armament,
      outclassed German light and medium tanks fielded in 1939–42. The M4 was
      the most-produced tank in American history, with 49,324 produced
      (including variants); During World War II, the Sherman spearheaded many
      offensives by the Western Allies after 1942.
    </p>
    <p class="rosi">
      When the M4 tank went into combat in North Africa with the British Army at
      the Second Battle of El Alamein in late 1942, it increased the advantage
      of Allied armor over Axis armor and was superior to the lighter German[10]
      and Italian tank designs. For this reason, the US Army believed that the
      M4 would be adequate to win the war, and relatively little pressure was
      initially exerted for further tank development. Logistical and transport
      restrictions, such as limitations imposed by roads, ports, and bridges,
      also complicated the introduction of a more capable but heavier
      tank.[11][N 2] Tank Destroyer battalions using vehicles built on the M4
      hull and chassis, but with open-topped turrets and more potent
      high-velocity guns, also entered widespread use in the Allied armies. Even
      by 1944, most M4 Shermans kept their dual-purpose 75 mm gun.[12] By then,
      the M4 was inferior in firepower and armor to increasing numbers of German
      upgraded medium tanks and heavy tanks but was able to fight on with the
      help of considerable numerical superiority, greater mechanical
      reliability, better logistical support, and support from growing numbers
      of fighter-bombers and artillery pieces.[13] Some Shermans were produced
      with a more armor-piercing gun, the 76 mm gun M1, refitted with a 76.2mm
      caliber Ordnance QF 17-pounder gun by the British (the Sherman Firefly),
      or given a 105mm gun to act as infantry support vehicles
    </p>
    <p class="rosi">
      The relative ease of production allowed large numbers of the M4 to be
      manufactured, and significant investment in tank recovery and repair units
      allowed disabled vehicles to be repaired and returned to service quickly.
      These factors combined to give the Allies numerical superiority in most
      battles, and many infantry divisions were provided with M4s and tank
      destroyers
    </p>
    <p class="rosi">
      After World War II, the Sherman, particularly the many improved and
      upgraded versions, continued to see combat service in many conflicts
      around the world, including the UN forces in the Korean War, with Israel
      in the Arab–Israeli wars, briefly with South Vietnam in the Vietnam War,
      and on both sides of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.

    <h3>4. T-34</h3>
    <div class="ummar">
      <p style="margin-right: 50px" class="rosi">
        The T-34 is a Soviet medium tank introduced in 1940, famously deployed
        with the Red Army during World War II against Operation Barbarossa. Its
        76.2 mm (3 in) tank gun was more powerful than its contemporaries[7]
        while its 60 degree sloped armour provided good protection against
        anti-tank weapons. The Christie suspension was inherited from the design
        of American J. Walter Christie's M1928 tank, versions of which were sold
        turret-less to the Red Army and documented as "farm tractors", after
        being rejected by the U.S. Army. The T-34 had a profound effect on the
        conflict on the Eastern Front in the Second World War, and had a lasting
        impact on tank design. After the Germans encountered the tank in 1941,
        German general Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist called it "the finest tank
        in the world"[8] and Heinz Guderian affirmed the T-34's "vast
        superiority" over German tanks.[9][10] Alfred Jodl, chief of operations
        staff of the German armed forces noted in his war diary "the surprise at
        this new and thus unknown wunder-armament being unleashed against the
        German assault divisions,"[11] although its armour and armament were
        surpassed later in the war.
      </p>
      <img src="./assets//T34 image.jpg" alt="" style="width: 300px" />
    </div>
    <p class="rosi">
      The T-34 was the mainstay of Soviet armoured forces throughout the war.
      Its general specifications remained nearly unchanged until early 1944,
      when it received a firepower upgrade with the introduction of the greatly
      improved T-34-85 variant. Its production method was continuously refined
      and rationalized to meet the needs of the Eastern Front, making the T-34
      quicker and cheaper to produce. The Soviets ultimately built over 80,000
      T-34s of all variants, allowing steadily greater numbers to be fielded
      despite the loss of tens of thousands in combat against the German
      Wehrmacht.[13] Replacing many light and medium tanks in Red Army service,
      it was the most-produced tank of the war, as well as the second
      most-produced tank of all time (after its successor, the T-54/T-55
      series).[14] With 44,900 lost during the war, it also suffered the most
      tank losses ever.[15] Its development led directly to the T-44, then the
      T-54 and T-55 series of tanks, which in turn evolved into the later T-62,
      that form the armoured core of many modern armies. T-34 variants were
      widely exported after World War II, and as recently as 2010 more than 130
